<h1>Hi, I'm Islam.</h1>

<br/><br/>
Iâ€™m a Senior Researcher and Software Development Engineer at RDI and an MSc student at Cairo University. 
I am interested in teaching machines common sense to enable them to communicate effectively and collaborate with their human partners.

I share some of the things I learn here in the form of blog posts. Feel free to visit the Writing section!
