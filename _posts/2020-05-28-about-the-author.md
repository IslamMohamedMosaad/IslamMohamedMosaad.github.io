<h1>Hi, I'm Islam.</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>I am a Senior Researcher and Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.rdi-eg.com/">RDI</a> and an MSc student at Cairo University.</p>
<p>I am interested in teaching machines common sense to enable them to communicate effectively and collaborate with their human partners.</p>
<p>I share somethings that I learned here in the form of blog posts. Feel free to visit the Writing section!</p>
